At this time since we cannot have every motor tuning sorted out, you can use the existing [Klipper configuration](../../../../Software/Firmware/klipper) and modify the existing entries for driver_SGTHRS for each axis. 

You can also choose which of our additional modifications to use

Enabling them with our pre-built config is as easy as uncommenting a line! (PiTFT50 requires additional configuration/setup outside of printer.cfg)

[TFT35-E3 Screen](../../mods/TFT35-E3.md) - The Stock screen that comes with the Baby Belt, to be used in Marlin Mode.  
[BTT PiTFT50](../../mods/TFT50.md) - Use KlipperScreen with a TouchScreen  
[Degree Sensor Switch](../../mods/degree_sensor_switch.md) - Let your printer detect if you are at 30° or 45°  
[UART connection](../../mods/uart_connection.md) - Keep things clean with wires internal between your Pi and board!  
[XL Mod](../../mods//baby_belt_pro_XL.md) - Baby Belt Pro... but BIGGER!
