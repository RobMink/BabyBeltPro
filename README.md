## The Printcepts Ethos
Remember when you didn't need 30 different types of screw to build your 3D printer? Printcepts remembers...  
We strive for a minimalist approach and don't go adding hardware "just because". If there is a screw that isn't an M3x10 or M3x20 SHCS we've got a very good reason for it!  
Printcepts started with a concept of taking parts you had lying around and making use of them. We want to thank everyone who gave us feedback, who wanted us to improve and we took that to heart! At it's core the Baby Belt Project will have its roots in re-using parts and being affordable. That's why we  

## TODO  
- better layout for slicer profiles, 30 vs 45.  

## Slicers that support Belt Printing
- [Kirimoto](https://grid.space/kiri/)
- [IdeaMaker](https://www.raise3d.com/ideamaker/)
- [BlackBelt Cura](https://blackbelt-3d.com/download-software/)* (We are not currently working on a profile for this slicer, mentioned simply as a potential option)
- [Command Line Blackbelt Cura](https://www.autodrop3d.com/blackbelt-slicer.html)* (See above)


## Printing your parts
0.2 MM layer height, 5 walls, 18% or so infill.  Parts say if they need support or number count.

When Printing your parts, you need a stiff material like PLA or PETG; We love the variety and range of PLA filaments, making each Baby Belt Pro unique!   
The only part at the time of writing that *CANNOT* be PLA, is the Bed/Underbed as it requires more heat resistance.  
A good rule of thumb is if you only ever plan to print PLA or TPU, your Bed/Underbed can be PETG. However, if printing in PETG, it is **HIGHLY** suggested to use ABS or ASA.
