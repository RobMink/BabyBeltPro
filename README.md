BabyBelt Pro (V2.5 , see branches for V1 or V2)

V2.5 changes - Print at 30 or 45 degrees.  Better underbed, one Y linear rail.  Better wire routing, Holes for run out and better mounting options for pi and more.  Stronger bed tention system.  Better gantry setup with X upgraded belt tention.  Homes Y to bed.  marlin needs update for full kit compatability.

TODO - better layout for slicer profiles, 30 vs 45.  

0.2 MM layer height, 5 walls, 18% or so infill.  Parts say if they need supports or number count.

I guess you can print it in anything other than TPU or PVA.  I print most in PLA or PETG, Underbed must NOT be PLA for heat resistance reasons (ABS, PETG... Ok!)
